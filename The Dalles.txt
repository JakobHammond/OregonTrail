The Dalles...
Hannah King speaks quietly to you...
“Many fur trappers will approach you in these parts trying to get you to trade. Make sure to spend your money on things you and your passengers really need. May God lead you and your family to the place you are headed. For he will take hold of your right hand and help you.”
